# Handling-Complex-Images-Happy-or-Sad-Dataset

In this project I used the happy or sad dataset, which contains 80 images of emoji-like faces, 40 happy and 40 sad.

I created a convolutional neural network that trains to 99.9% accuracy on these images,  which cancels training upon hitting this training accuracy threshold.
